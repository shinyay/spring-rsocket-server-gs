# Spring RSocket Getting Started

RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP, WebSockets, and Aeron.
It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection:

- request/response (stream of 1)
- request/stream (finite stream of many)
- fire-and-forget (no response)
- channel (bi-directional streams)
